# Working with Cloud 9
Review the Video walkthrough here: [Office Mix](https://mix.office.com/watch/1w8lekdndxjhq)

### Logon to Cloud 8
Go to [http://c9.io](http://c9.io) and logon with GitHub or whatever credentials you choose

### Create your Workspace
Call it whatever you like, but choose "Custom".

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/cs612-f15/tomcat-mysql-c9.git

cd tomcat-mysql-c9

```

## Setting up MySQL
MySQL is already installed.

Run the following from your `~/workspace/tomcat-mysql-c9` directory.

```
./setupMySql.sh
```

## Setting up Tomcat
The following will download V8 of Tomcat and unpack it to `./tomcat`

Run the following from your `~/workspace/tomcat-mysql-c9` directory.

```
./setupTomcat.sh
```

## Building Java classes

Once the Tomcat script is run, the `survey.war` file is deployed to `./tomcat/webapps` and as the Survey site is 
requested, Tomcat extracts the WAR file.

## Make sure you "Run" the site so it expands..

1. Choose "preview" from C9.io interface
2. Preview Running application
3. Popout in New window
3. Change the URL - appending `/survey` to the Server Name

## once the site is run, Tomcat 'expands' the `survey.war` file

This WAR file contains all the content, JSP, Class - and the Java source files.

A helper script allows you build `*.java` source files, then build, then restart tomcat.

```
./buildJava.sh
./tomcat/bin/catalina.sh stop
./tomcat/bin/cataling.sh start
```

# Important - Update the UserName Password

Go into the `./tomcat/webapps/survey/WEB-INF/classes/survey/DatabaseAccess.java` file

Edit the lines to change the user from `root` to `cs612`

Should look like this:

```java
  String jdbcDriver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver";
  String dbURL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test";
  String user = "cs612";
  String password = "123456";
```

Recompile, then restart Tomcat...

```bash
./buildJava.sh
./tomcat/bin/catalina.sh stop
./tomcat/bin/catalina.sh start
```

Note: JSP file changes are immediately reprocessed and reflected within Tomcat.
Class files, sourced from Java files, requires a "restart" of Tomcat - that is what the `./tomcat/bin/catalina.sh stop/start` provides.
